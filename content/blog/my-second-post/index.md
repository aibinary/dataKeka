Everything from a smart watch to Spacex starship have the capacity to run code.
Code makes them smarter and C++ plays a vital role in this revolution.
Bjarne Stroustup began working on "C with classes" in 1979 at Bell Labs. The language was renamed as C++ in 1983.

Let's have a look at key benefits of the language:

- Performance
- Portability
- General Purpose
- Libraries

CPP or C++ is a high level programming language. 

To learn a new language like English/Telugu/Hindi, we first need to understand the structure that builds the language.
Let's start the journey by taking a look at famous "Hello world Program".

```cpp
//Hello world example
#include <iostream>

int main(){

    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}                                         

```
Lets take a look at the basic anatomy of this program, shall we?

First line is a comment. Comments are useful while writing code. It makes the program more readable.

The second line has a preprocessor directive include. It means "copy here". Tells the compiler to copy the "iostream" header file here.

main() is where the actual program starts in CPP followed by curly braces.
Next, we have an IO statement that will output some text to the console:

```cpp
 std::cout << "Hello, world!";
```

The program does'nt return anything, hence it has to end with "return 0".
