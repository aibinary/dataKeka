Everything from a smart watch to a Spacex starship have the capacity to run code.
Code makes them smarter and C++ plays a vital role in this revolution.
Bjarne Stroustup began working on "C with classes" in 1979 at Bell Labs. The language was renamed as C++ in 1983.

Let's have a look at key benefits of C++ language:

- Performance
- Portability
- General Purpose
- Libraries

CPP or C++ is a high level programming language. 

To learn a new language like Telugu/Sanskrit, we first need to understand the undelying structure/syntax.
Start the journey by taking a look at famous "Hello world Program".

```cpp
//Hello world example
#include <iostream>

int main(){

    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}                                         

```
First line is a comment. Comments are useful while writing code. It makes the program more readable.

The second line starts with a pound sign and preprocessor directive 'include'. It tells the compiler to copy "iostream" header file here.

"main()" is where the actual program starts in CPP followed by curly braces.
Next, we have an IO statement that will output text to the console:

```cpp
 std::cout << "Hello, world!";
```

The program does'nt return anything, hence it has to end with "return 0".
Thats our first program in the wonderful world of C++.
